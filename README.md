# FINA4350 WSB Sentiment and Stock Returns
By Simplicity

# Overview
This project aims to analyze the correlation between the sentiment of r/wallstreetbets posts and stock returns. By posts, we mean we will analyze the title, content, and the highest upvoted comment. Since there are a lot of images used, when analyzing the posts individually, we realized that the highest upvoted comment will often be taking about the image. We also wanted to identify what stock the post is talking about, conduct sentiment analysis on it using VADER, and then visualize the correlation.
